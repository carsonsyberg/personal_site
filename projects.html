            Electric Vehicle Ecosystem Exhibit
        </h3>
        <p>
            As part of a year long project for our Electrical-Computer Engineering Capstone class, myself and a team of 5 others
            were tasked with creating an educational exhibit for our company sponsor Mission Zero. The parameters of the project
            were that we had to create custom hardware and custome software that completed the requirements given to us by our sponsor.
            The first semester was spent planning and creating documentation explaining our system from the ground up, as well as some
            initial writing of code. The second semester we spent building, programming, and debugging our project. Working on seperate
            portions of the project proved challenging once we had to put it all together, but we managed to integrate everything 
            and ended with a fully functional project. Our exhibit consisted of three 4 ft. by 8 ft. tables with a model city layed out on them.
            Our custom built car autonamously drives around this model city, stopping at certain locations of interest. There is also
            a system of smart LED strips layed out to dispaly the flow of energy around our model city. All of this is connected with 
            a tablet using a progressive web app to control which location the car should be traveling to, what lights go on, and give
            more information to the user on what exactly they are looking at.

            Embedded C Physics Engine
        </h3>
        <p>
            Using Micrium OS on a Pearl Gecko development board, I created a physics based game that utilizes the inputs on the development board for controls.
            The Gecko board has a capactive touch sensor capable of reading 4 different touch zones, two buttons, and an LCD screen.
            I created 7 different tasks for controlling the different aspects of the game. The basic idea of the game is to protect
            the bottom of the screen from being hit with falling balls by bouncing them away with a movable platform. The touch sensor
            applies differing amounts of force left or right to the platform. One button controls a laser that auto destroys 
            the ball anywhere on screen, with a limited number of available shots. The other button allows the platform to 
            accelerate the ball upward if pressed within a certain time interval of impact. If that button is not pressed, the ball
            simply slows down until a certain speed where it phases through the platform and the game is lost. If the user manages
            to hit a certain amount of balls off the top of the screen, they win. The hardest part of this project was debugging
            when tasks were interfering with each other. I had a deadlock happen because of the order I was making mutex locks in 
            through the different tasks, but after many hours of debugging I was able to fix it and get a working final game. I also
            created a number of unit tests for testing the smaller pieces of my plain C code before integrating it into the RTOS system.

            This <a href="https://brewviews.herokuapp.com/">brewery review site</a> was my final project for a Software Development Methods course. The requirements of the project
            were to use a brewery database API to create a site where users can search by city name for a list of breweries
            in that city, and also write and upload reviews of breweries to another page of the site. I used a SQL database
            to store the uploaded reviews, and javascript to bring in the information from the database to be displayed on the site.
            I used Bootstrap classes for much of the site's css design. For deployment, I used Heroku.

            Frog Jumping Logic Problem
        </h3>
        <p>
            I created this project as part of my discrete math course. The goal was to analyze and solve a logic
            problem using python. I chose the <a href="https://mathpickle.com/project/jumping-frogs/">Frog Jumping logic problem</a>.
            To solve this problem, I decided to generate all possible sets of movements given the constraints of the rules
            of the logic problem. There are waterlogged pads that cannot be jumped on to, and there are frogs which can jump
            to either open pads, or on top of another frog to stack up. To get a solution, all frogs must end up stacked together.
            Following the rules of the game, my python code generates a branching tree of all the different possible moves, 
            starting with each possible first move, and continuing down the tree until a solution is found. Analyzing my solution
            found that while it works well up to a point, once the problem gets too big or complex, the time to find a solution
            grows logarithmically.

        <p>
            During sophomore year, my friends and I spent a lot of time playing the card game Tiến lên. It's a four player 
            game, where each player is dealt 13 cards, and the first to have no cards left wins. In Tiến lên there are only
            certain valid combinations are cards to play: singles, pairs, triples, quadruples, and sequences. There are special
            case rules with the two card and when suits in a sequence are the same. For a C programming final project, my
            roommate and I reccreated this card game to be playable by four people in the terminal. The hardest part of the project
            was finding ways to incorporate all the different special case rulings, and to ensure that players could not
            play invalid moves. All of the programming for this project was done in a Linux virtual machine using Emacs.

            connecting it all together. This was my first foray into embedded systems, and taught me the importance of user manuals
            and data sheets in embedded systems programming. Upon finishing construction, we had a bit of debugging to get through,
            but managed to get a working prototype that could count up or down as people entered or exited a doorway with our IR sensor
            bar mounted on the door frame.

            This was a freshman project completed by myself and a team of two others. The requirements of the class were
            that we build something using an arduino, sensors, and outputs to respond to the sensors inputs. Our group
            decided to attempt to construct a car that would drive by itself along a path, given to it by directional buttons 
            atop the car body. A user could program the car to go straight, turn 90 degrees, or go backwards, and any combination 
            of those movements, then pressing the center button would execute the stored movements. We did manage to accomplish
            this in code, and managed to make the wheels turn as we expected given series of button inputs. However, we lacked
            knowledge of the mechanical aspects of the project, and the motors we chose, as well as the design of our car, 
            made it impossible for the car to actually carry out the programmed movements.
