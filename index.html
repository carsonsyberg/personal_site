        Using Micrium OS on a Pearl Gecko development board, I created a physics based game that 
        utilizes the inputs on the development board for controls.

        In this project I used a brewery database API to create a site where you can search for lists of breweries in a city, 
        as well as write reviews that are posted to the site and stored with MySQL.

            Electric Vehicle Ecosystem Exhibit
        </h2>
        <p>
            This past spring, after a year of planning and building, my capstone team "Grid vs Evil"
            won the 2022 Sustainability Solutions Showcase in the energy category, as well
            as the judges top score out of 14 electrical engineering teams at the
            2022 CU Engineering Expo. Our project was an educational exhibit designed to teach users about electric
            vehicles being used for energy transport and storage. We built a model city
            across three 4 foot by 8 foot tables. LED strips were layed out across
            the tables to simulate the flow of energy around an electrical grid,
            to simulate charging and dischargin of the vehicle, and to display a power
            outage scenario to highlight how electric cars could improve grid resiliency.  
            Driving through our model city was a model electric vehicle, 
            complete with a 3D printed Tesla body, a custom PCB, 
            and a navigation algorithm to allow recalculating paths around the city to
            certain destinations. The third part of our exhibit was a tablet mounted on
            the center table with a progressive web app that communicated to the model
            via bluetooth. On the web app were location choices to send the car to, as
            well as educational information describing the scenario they see on the model.

            We originally built this project in the basement of our engineering center,
            so ensuring it was easy to take apart and put back together was crucial.
            In total, we had to present our exhibit at 3 different locations. The exhibit
            seperates into 6 tables, the buildings have pegs at the corners to slot into
            the tables, the legs of the tables come off, and the LED strips on the tables
            disconnect from each other with pin connectors under the table connections.

            Current Project
        </h2>
        <p>
            I'm currently working on a game that takes inspiration from the board game Settlers of Catan
            and the video game Civilization 6. I'm using javascript and Phaser to create the game to be
            playable in browser. So far, I've completed some basic map generation
            but am planning on making more complex and realistic generation after I complete more of the basic structure
            of the game. I have objects for the tiles, roads, and cities, and my next step is to implement
            the city and road objects across the map and design rules for how they can be placed.
