        <h2>Embedded C Physics Engine</h2>
        <p>
          Using Micrium OS on a Pearl Gecko development board, I created a
          physics based game that utilizes the inputs on the development board
          for controls.

        <h2>Brewery Review Site</h2>
        <p>
          In this project I used a brewery database API to create a site where
          you can search for lists of breweries in a city, as well as write
          reviews that are posted to the site and stored with MySQL.

        <p>
          With a Texas Instruments MSP432 development board, some 7-segment
          displays, and infrared sensors, my project partner and I created this
          system to count up or down as people enter or exit a room.

        <h2>Current Project</h2>
        <p>
          I'm currently working on a workout web app to help track my fitness
          goals. So far, I have the React frontend built, a NodeJS / ExpressJS
          backend, and an AWS MySQL database. My main goal at the moment for the
          project is getting it hosted and starting continuous development and
          deployment. I've managed to get the backend dockerized and hosted as
          an EC2 instance on AWS, as well as managed to get the frontend hosted
          on Netlify. However, I'm running into some errors in getting my
          frontend and backend to talk now that they no longer both reside on my
          personal machine. I also have plans to greatly expand on the
          functionality of the app. I hope to include progress tracking and
          graphing, a social media aspect to allow the sharing and copying of
          workouts, and an algorithm to generate estimated workout weights to
          help people figure out how much they should be lifting and increasing
          in weight every week.

        <h2>Electric Vehicle Ecosystem Exhibit</h2>
        <p>
          This past spring, after a year of planning and building, my capstone
          team "Grid vs Evil" won the 2022 Sustainability Solutions Showcase in
          the energy category, as well as the judges top score out of 14
          electrical engineering teams at the 2022 CU Engineering Expo. Our
          project was an educational exhibit designed to teach users about
          electric vehicles being used for energy transport and storage. We
          built a model city across three 4 foot by 8 foot tables. LED strips
          were laid out across the tables to simulate the flow of energy around
          an electrical grid, to simulate charging and discharging of the
          vehicle, and to display a power outage scenario to highlight how
          electric cars could improve grid resiliency. Driving through our model
          city was a model electric vehicle, complete with a 3D printed Tesla
          body, a custom PCB, and a navigation algorithm to allow recalculating
          paths around the city to certain destinations. The third part of our
          exhibit was a tablet mounted on the center table with a progressive
          web app that communicated to the model via bluetooth. On the web app
          were location choices to send the car to, as well as educational
          information describing the scenario they see on the model. We
          originally built this project in the basement of our engineering
          center, so ensuring it was easy to take apart and put back together
          was crucial. In total, we had to present our exhibit at 3 different
          locations. The exhibit separated into 6 tables, the buildings have
          pegs at the corners to slot into the tables, the legs of the tables
          come off, and the LED strips on the tables disconnect from each other
          with pin connectors under the table connections.
